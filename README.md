# Java Coding Files

Welcome to the **Java Coding Files** repository! This project contains a wide variety of Java code examples, from basic syntax and data types to advanced topics like JDBC, Swing, AWT, multithreading, and more. Whether you're a beginner or looking to brush up on specific Java concepts, you'll find useful code samples here.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **Basic Java Programs**: Simple programs demonstrating variables, data types, operators, loops, and conditionals.
- **OOP Concepts**: Examples of classes, objects, inheritance, constructors, and multiple inheritance.
- **Advanced Java**: Multithreading, pattern printing, and type casting.
- **User Input**: Programs that take input from the user.
- **JDBC**: Database connectivity examples (CRUD operations, image handling, etc.) in the `JDBC/` folder.
- **Swing & AWT**: GUI examples using Java Swing and AWT in the `Swing  AWT/` folder.

## 🖼️ About Java AWT & Swing

**AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)** and **Swing** are Java’s main libraries for building Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs):

- **AWT** provides basic UI components (buttons, windows, menus) that use your computer’s native look and feel.
- **Swing** builds on AWT, offering more advanced, flexible, and customizable components (tables, trees, sliders, etc.) with a consistent appearance across platforms.

Explore the `Swing  AWT/` folder for examples on:

- Creating windows and frames
- Handling button clicks and events
- Using layouts, menus, sliders, and more

These examples help you learn how to build interactive desktop applications in Java!

## 🗄️ About Java JDBC

**JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)** is an API for connecting and executing queries with databases from Java applications. With JDBC, you can:

- Connect to databases (like MySQL, Oracle, etc.)
- Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Handle images and binary data in databases

Check the `JDBC/` folder for code samples on:

- Inserting, updating, and retrieving data
- Working with images in databases
- Dynamic and secure database operations

These examples are great for learning how to integrate Java applications with real-world databases.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Compile a Java file:**
   ```sh
   javac FileName.java
   ```
2. **Run the compiled class:**
   ```sh
   java FileName
   ```
   > Replace `FileName` with the name of the Java file you want to run (without `.java`).
